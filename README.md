# QotdToSms
A (simple) script to send a Quote of The Day via SMS using the French mobile operator "Free Mobile" sms notification option.

It means this can only work if you have a suscribed one of the two plans available at http://mobile.free.fr

That being said, if you're one of the greedy french people who chose to use the *young* and *not very mature*, but **promising**, Free Mobile network, then you'll be able to activate the sms notifications through the web console (once authenticated on http://mobile.free.fr).

Once the option is activated, you'll need to retrieve the credentials on the option page that will be used in the script. These credentials will have you authenticated on Free Mobile servers (basically this will send a sms using **your** phone number).
